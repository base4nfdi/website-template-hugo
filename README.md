This reporsitory provides a [Hugo]((https://gohugo.io/) template for a Base4NFDI baisc service website. By default it includes a blog/newsfeed, publications, people in the project and a wiki, but can be custumized in any way to your needs.
In this template, 'TODO' is used as a placeholder in every place you need to fill in your own service information, so you can just search for it, change/fill out every instance and the site should be ready to use.

TODO: insert yout service logo
